The SnowLynx Speed Unit Converter is one of a collection of CLI based programs produced by Dvlsh::Sftwr, rooted in Fluffykins's creative boredom. This perticular
program was the result of a dispute on what 35 mph was in kph in some random discord server, and no one's willingess to google it. Not to mention Fluffy's
insufferable need to be right.

"You are free to do as you please with this code. You can use the functions in your own programs which need it, use it a study materal, use it as just a speed unit 
converter for the CLI as it was made for, develop it further and submit it to me (I WILL MOST CERTINLY LIST YOU HERE AS A DEVELOPER ^,..,^ if you do the work, you 
get the credit!), hell, do what you want with it, just remember who you got it from! >;3" -Fluffykins
