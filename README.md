# SnowLynx
The SnowLynx is a collection of open source CLI based programs produced by Dvlsh::Sftwr, rooted in Fluffykins's creative boredom. These programs are for any use, may it be practical, educational, or just plain fun.

"You are free to do as you please with this code. You can use the functions in your own programs which need it, use it a study materal, use it as just the CLI 
programs they where made to be, develop them further and submit (I WILL MOST CERTINLY LIST YOU HERE AS A DEVELOPER ^,..,^ if you do the work, you 
get the credit!), hell, do what you want with them, just remember who you got them from! >;3" -Fluffykins

slsuc - spd-cnvrt.c, spd-def.c/h
The SnowLynx Speed Unit Converter, abreviated 'slsuc', is a CLI based speed and distance unit converter. It was born from a dispute on a discord server as to 
what 35mph is in kph and nobody wanting to look the differences up so a propper accurate calculation could be made, as well as Fluffy's insufferable need to be right.
