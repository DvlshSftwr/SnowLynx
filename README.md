# SnowLynx
SnowLynx is a collection of open source CLI based programs produced by Dvlsh::Sftwr, rooted in Fluffykins's creative boredom. These programs are for any use, may it be practical, educational, or just plain fun.

"You are free to do as you please with this code. You can use the functions in your own programs which need it, use it a study materal, use it as just the CLI 
programs they where made to be, develop them further and submit (**I WILL MOST CERTINLY LIST YOU HERE AS A DEVELOPER** ^,..,^ if you do the work, you 
get the credit!), hell, do what you want with them, just remember who you got them from! >;3" -Fluffykins

### slsuc - spd-cnvrt.c, spd-def.c/h

The SnowLynx Speed Unit Converter, abreviated 'slsuc', is a CLI based speed and distance unit converter. It was born from a dispute on a discord server as to 
what 35mph is in kph and nobody wanting to look the differences up so a propper accurate calculation could be made, as well as Fluffy's insufferable need to be right. 

### slifb - slifb.cxx

"I made a FizzBuzzer in C++...then I got bored...and this happened...I've spent _waaay_ too much time on this! XD" - Fluffykins

The SnowLynx Interactive FizzBuzzer started out as a simple FizzBuzz program in c++ for practice, but, once again, Fluffy just couldn't help himself and _absolutely 
had_ to do more to it, and so, interactive elements where added. Then the program was modularized. Next thing you know, it's gonna be split up into 40 more files 
and be able to crack NASA passwords. What the fuck man.
